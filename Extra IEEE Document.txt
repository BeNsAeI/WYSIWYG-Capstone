a) what is the functionality? what is the software supposed to do
- It is supposed to create a graphical user interface in order to abstract away the tensorflow api and make using this api effortless
- there are software requirments aswell

b) External Interface;
- Create a diagram , how does the software interact with people

c) Performance: what is speed, availibility, response time, recovery time, various software fucntions
- This GUI is generally creating a text blueprint and it needs to be very fast and responisve to operate.
- Each part needs to be as fast as possible

d)Attributes: what are the portability, correctness, maintainability, security, etc, consideration
- it needs to be very reliable. The design should be reproducable
- it needs to b 100% correct every time in the code level.
- it cannot affort to have bugs
- portable, multiplatform
- Security is  not a concern ffor this software since it is just a cape that abstarcts away a core system that is already implemented (unless it is web based)

e)Constraints: what are the constraints imposed on implementation
- This project is very user based and the only constraints are imposed on usability of our software and the core library that we are trying to mask
- It needs to be easily understood by the user and developer
- It needs to be effortless to use and accurate. The results need to be reliable and dependable
- The core system has its own limitations and our GUI is going to have same limitations.
