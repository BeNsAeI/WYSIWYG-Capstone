# This Core file generates and outputs the python file based on the data structure
# Initiate generator using constructor (it starts the EXECUTION())
# For each element in table of execution:
# 1: Get the function from list
# 2: Get the parametters from execution tree using the channel ID
# 3: generate and format the line
# 4: Open the output file
# 5: Add the string to the file
# 6: close the file
# de struct the program which Calls the EXECUTION()
